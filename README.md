## Ethics Contract

**FIRST**: Please read the following carefully:

-	I have not received, I have not given, nor will I give or receive, any assistance to another student taking this exam, including discussing the exam with students in another section of the course. Do not discuss the exam after you are finished until final grades are submitted.
- If I use any resource (including text books and online references and websites), I will cite them in my assignment.
- I will not ask question about how to debug my exam code on Piazza or any other platform.
-	I will not plagiarize someone else's work and turn it in as my own. If I use someone else's work in this exam, I will cite that work. Failure to cite work I used is plagiarism.
-	I understand that acts of academic dishonesty may be penalized to the full extent allowed by the Lehigh University Code of Conduct, including receiving a failing grade for the course. I recognize that I am responsible for understanding the provisions of the Lehigh University Code of Conduct as they relate to this academic exercise.

If you agree with the above, type your full name in the following space along with the date. Your exam **will not be graded** without this assent. When you are done, make your first commit with the commit message: "I, <your name>, agree to the ethics contract".

## Option 1: Implement FastSLAM

This option is an automatic A. All you have to do is implement the FastSLAM algorithm, a good summary of which is in the Probabilistic Robotics book on page 450. Homework 4 would be a good starting place for this. You can use the same bearing only cameras, or you can add the range in there if you want. It should work either way. You can also use the same robot model and the same noise model. Or you can just add Gaussian noise to everything. Either way, if you can get this algorithm working well, that's an A for you. Just submit the algorithm and a video or series of pictures showing it working. If you provide a series of still images, annotate them to show me what's going on in each one. If you provide a video, host it on youtube and give me a link. It's easy to [record your screen using zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording). Either give me a voice annotation of what's going on, or write it out in this README with timestamps indicating what is happening.

## Option 2 (2 parts, equal weight)

For this option you'll have to do two problems.

### Part 1

First, Implement one of the following algorithms: 

- A* - Implement the A* algorithm in Matlab. The input to the algorithm can be an adjacency matrix, which is easy to implement in Matlab. The graph will represent a grid world, where each cell connects to its 8 neighbors, with `1` dist to the adjacent ones and `2^.5` distance to the diagonal ones. Represent obstacles by removing edges to neighboring cells. The input to the algorithm should be the start and goal cells. Make a figure that shows the start, goal, any obstacles, and the path found by the algorithm.

- Particle Filter - Implement a particle filter algorithm in Matlab. Homework 4 might be a good place to start with this one. You can keep the same cameras and the same bearing measurements, or you can also add in range. The robot model can be the same too. But instead of tracking a mean and covariance, you'll track a number of hypothetical robot particles. The spread of those robots will represent uncertainty, and you can take the mean of their positions as a guess for where they are. You can find a good particle filter algorithm on page 96 of the Probabilistic Robotics book. 

- Enhanced PID Wall Follower - Change the wall follower in Homework 3 as follows: 1) Handle a walls that are angled. 2) Make this a PID controller instead of just a PD controller. Demonstrate it working by having the robot follow a wall that changes direction. For example, the wall starts out horizontal, but then starts to become angled downward like this (X marks the robot, it wants to go to the right):

```
------------------\
                   \
    X->             \
                     \
                      \
```

- Trajectory Rollout - Implement the Trajectory Rollout algorithm described by [Gerkey and Konolige](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.330.2120&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Also described in [Lecture 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buEfiJftc0E&list=PL4A2v89SXU3SUUNrwKcE-yy2SX6YQOg_p&index=9&t=0s). Demonstrate this controller working in with the wall follower robot in Homework 3. You'll replace the PD controller with the Trajectory Rollout controller, and you can leave everything else the same.

**Once you are done implementing:**

Demonstrate the algorithm working with a video or a series of stills. If you provide a series of still images, annotate them to show me what's going on in each one. If you provide a video, host it on youtube and give me a link. It's easy to [record your screen using zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording). Either give me a voice annotation of what's going on, or write it out in this README with timestamps indicating what is happening.

### Part 2

Choose one of the show-and-tell videos posted in our Slack channel. **You cannot choose the one you shared**. Based on what we learned in this course, form a hypothesis for how it works. Can you discern any sensors that are on the robot? What are they detecting? What sensors would this robot need theoretically to work? How does the robot use the info it collects from its sensors? How is the robot going from point A to point B? How does the robot know where it is? How is the robot avoiding obstacles? What do you observe about the robot's behavior leads you to your conclusions? What failure modes will the robot encounter (where won't the robot work?)

There are really no wrong or right answers here. I just want you to show me that you understand the architecture of robots we talked about in this class, and to see if you can apply that knowledge to a real-world example. You may be completely wrong, but that's not the point of this question.

The cyan delivery robot is a rather standard automated robot.  Its purpose is to safely deliver one food from one location to another.  It accomplishes this by using sensors on the front of the car to see any potential obstacles like pedestrians or cars and either skirt around them or wait until it is safe to move again by using motors attached to wheels to pivot and move as seen from the demonstration video as it waits for a car to pass .  To find its way to the customers door it uses a gps from which I am guessing it is using dijkstras algorithm or more likely an A* algorithm to find the quickest way, with a heuristic approach of shortest total distance traveled (has a battery) and excludes any stairs as it does not have the capability to maneuver them.  AlthoughI have not found anything about it using an odometer (nor does it necessarily need one) but I would be surprised if it did not have one as it could much more confidently tell where it was reducing noise overall for its kalman filter.  For example if the gps starts to give incorrect readings, it would realize that although the gps says it is 2 miles away from where it actually is, the odometer would more accurately tell it that its wheels have only spun a Â½ mile worth of distance (unless it is getting stolen which is a separate problem)  The combination of these three sensors should enable it to safely and efficiently navigate its way.  Other failure states could include certain weather such as fooding/large puddles which could be hard to detect with light sensors and would more likely be monitored by the user rather than having the robot figure it out
